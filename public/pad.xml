      <Char_Desc_2000>How often your cursor jumps to another paragraph when you are typing a text on
        notebook and accentually touch a touchpad by hand? Hate this behavior? Me too!

        So, I've created a small program to solve this annoying problem. Touchpad Blocker
        automatically disables mouse events for a few moments if some key has been pressed. Why
        system drivers for touchpad have no such option? Strange...
