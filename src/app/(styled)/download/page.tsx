      <Typo variant="header2">Typing on PC with sensitivity touchpad can be frustrating</Typo>
      <Typo variant="paragraph">
        Have you ever experienced your cursor unexpectedly leaping to another paragraph while typing on a notebook,
        especially when your hand rests on or hovers over the touchpad? It's a common source of irritation for everyone!
      </Typo>
      <Typo variant="paragraph">
        Fortunately, there's a simple solution to this annoying problem. <strong>{APP_NAME}</strong> is a compact
        program designed to address this issue. It temporarily deactivates touchpad clicks and taps when a key is
        pressed on the keyboard. This straightforward trick proves effective in preventing the cursor from
        unintentionally jumping around, offering a hassle-free typing experience.
